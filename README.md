## Extension Installation/Setup
- Visit the [website](https://browser-pop.vercel.app/) and download the .zip file. Alternatively, the zip file can also be downloaded from the github [repo](https://github.com/MayankBansal12/browser-pop) or using this [link](https://github.com/MayankBansal12/browser-pop/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
- Extract the download .zip file and ensure the same code structure as in the [repo](https://github.com/MayankBansal12/browser-pop)
- Visit your browser settings, enable developer mode, and install from other sources to unpack the downloaded extension files.
- Once developer mode is enabled, extension files can be uploaded using 'load unpacked' or similar settings as per your browser.
- Extension should be added in your browser by now. Feel free to contact in case you face any issues or errors during installation or usage.

(Note:- Remember not to delete the extracted folder 'browser-pop-main' as it is what displays the content in your browser. You can also edit the HTML and CSS to improve the design or play around with JavaScript.)
